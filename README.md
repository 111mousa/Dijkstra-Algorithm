# Dijkstra
###Implementing Dijkstra algorithm by take the Longitude and latitude of the cities and compute the distance by The formula for the distance between two points
### to get the shortest path from the start point and end point which are the user choose them
### also i create the algorithm which choose random cities and random adjacent and the adjacent for each city does not exceeds for adjacent
### I donig this project by using java and javafx
